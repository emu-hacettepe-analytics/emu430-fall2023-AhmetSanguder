# Assignment 1

```{r}
1 + 1
```

My first assignment has two parts.

## (a)

## (b)

## 1)**Syntax for Control Structures**:

The syntax for control structures like loops and conditional statements differs between R and Python. For instance, Python typically uses indentation to denote code blocks, while R uses curly braces.

**2)Indexing (0-based vs. 1-based)**:

In Python, indexing starts from 0, meaning the first element of an array or list is accessed using index 0. In R, indexing starts from 1, so the first element is accessed using index 1.
